# 📦 E-commerce Sales SQL Project

# 📌 About the Project
I created an E-commerce sales database using SQL with FOUR tables:
customers, orders, products, and order_details. I answered business questions using SQL queries.

# 🧱 Database Tables
- **customers:        customer_id, name, email
- **orders:           order_id, customer_id, order_date, status
- **products:         product_id, product_name, price
- **order_details:    order_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price

# ❓ Business Questions I Answered

1. List all customers and their total number of orders.

2) Show all orders with product names and order status.

3) List customers who have placed more than 1 order.”

4) Show each product and how many times it was ordered.

5) List the top 2 highest-paying customers (by total amount spent).
 
6) Show the running total of revenue (by payment date).

7) Find customers who have never made a payment

8) Find products that have been ordered but never delivered.
