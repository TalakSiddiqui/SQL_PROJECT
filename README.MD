E-commerce Sales Analysis Project (SQL)

🧠 Project Overview
This project simulates an E-commerce sales environment, where I used SQL to analyze customer behavior, order patterns, and product performance.
It includes a relational database with 4 interconnected tables and several SQL queries to answer common business questions.

The goal is to demonstrate my ability to work with real-world datasets using SQL for data cleaning, analysis, and reporting.

🗃️ Database Schema
The database consists of the following four tables:

Table Name	Description
customers:     Contains details about each customer
Orders:	 Records all customer orders
products:	 Details of items sold on the platform
order_details: Line-item level breakdown of each order

🔗 Relationships:

orders.customer_id → customers.customer_id

order_details.order_id → orders.order_id

order_details.product_id → products.product_id

🧩 Sample Data Columns

Customers
customer_id, name, email, location

Orders
order_id, customer_id, order_date, status

Products
product_id, product_name, category, price

Order_Details
order_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price

📌 Business Questions Answered
Here are some key questions I answered using SQL:

🏆 What are the top 5 best-selling products?

👥 Which customers placed the most orders?

💰 What is the total revenue generated by category?

📅 How many orders are placed each month?

🚫 How many orders were canceled or returned?

🌍 What is the average order value by customer location?

📦 Which products have the highest return rate?

🧮 Sample Query

Edit

SELECT c.name AS customer_name,
       COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY total_orders DESC
LIMIT 5;
